            <h3>Californiancation</h3>
            <p>Realease date: May 20, 2000 </p>
            <p> spies from China try to steal your mind's elation <br>
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation <br>
And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication</p>
<p>

    It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization <br>
    The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location <br>
    It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication 
</p>
<p>
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging <br>
Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?
</p>
<p>
First born unicorn <br>
Hardcore soft porn <br>
Dream of Californication <br>
Dream of Californication <br>
Dream of Californication <br>
Dream of Californication
</p>
<p>
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation <br>
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information <br>
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
</p>
<p>
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement <br>
And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station? <br>
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication
</p>
<p>
Born and raised by those who praise control of population <br>
Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation
</p>

First born unicorn <br>

</p><p>
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation <br>
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration <br>
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
</p><p>
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging <br>
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving?

            <h3>Otherside</h3>
            <p>Realease date: January 11, 2000</p>
            <p>
            How long, how long will I slide? <br>
Separate my side, I don't <br>
I don't believe it's bad <br>
Slit my throat it's all I ever
</p><p>
I heard your voice through a photograph <br>
I thought it up and brought up the past <br>
Once you know you can never go back <br>
I gotta take it on the other side
</p><p>
Centuries are what it meant to me <br>
A cemetery where I marry the sea <br>
Stranger things could never change my mind <br>
I gotta take it on the other side <br>
Take it on the other side <br>
Take it on, take it on
</p><p>
How long, how long will I slide? <br>
Separate my side, I don't <br>
I don't believe it's bad <br>
Slit my throat it's all I ever
</p><p>
Pour my life into a paper cup <br>
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts <br>
She wants to know, am I still a slut? <br>
I've got to take it on the other side
</p><p>
A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed <br>
A candidate for a soul mate bled <br>
Push the trigger and pull the thread <br>
I gotta take it on the other side <br>
Take it on the other side <br>
Take it on <br>
Take it on
</p><p>
How long, how long will I slide? <br>
Separate my side, I don't <br>
I don't believe it's bad <br>
Slit my throat it's all I ever
</p><p>
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride <br>
Burn me out, leave me on the other side <br>
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend <br>
I tear it down, I tear it down <br>
And then it's born again 
</p><p>
How long, how long will I slide? <br>
Separate my side, I don't <br>
I don't believe it's bad <br>
Slit my throat it's all I ever
</p><p>
How long, I don't, I don't believe it's bad <br>
Slit my throat it's all I ever

            <p>Realease date: May 25, 1999</p><p>
                Scar tissue that I wish you saw <br>
Sarcastic mister know-it-all <br>
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, 'cause <br>
With the birds I'll share
</p><p>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin' <br>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
</p><p>
Push me up against the wall <br>
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra <br>
Fallin' all over myself <br>
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause
</p><p>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin' <br>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin' <br>
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
</p><p>
Blood loss in a bathroom stall <br>
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl <br>
I wave goodbye to ma and pa <br>
'Cause with the birds I'll share
</p><p>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin' <br>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'
</p><p>
Soft spoken with a broken jaw <br>
Step outside but not to brawl and <br>
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall <br>
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and 
</p><p>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin'<br>
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin' <br>
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw <br>
Sarcastic mister know-it-all <br>
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, 'cause <br>
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share this lonely viewin' <br>
